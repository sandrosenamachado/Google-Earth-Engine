# Google-Earth-Engine
 Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Scientists, researchers, and developers utilize Earth Engine to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.

One of the key advantages of using GEE is its interactive nature, which facilitates an iterative approach to developing supervised classification workflows. This involves blending multiple datasets together to create robust models. GEE grants access to vast amounts of remotely sensed spatial datasets, empowering users to efficiently process this data using machine learning algorithms and batch processing, thereby ensuring timely and effective geo-processing.
